## About
- This is a simple project to use React with a Bun server in production.
- Bun will serve using Elysia as the web server and server-render the React app.
- Vite is used to bundle the client side code as the server side code is not bundled anymore just executed by Bun.
- HMR is fully working with React-refresh manually imported from Vite bundling server available for Development only. The complexity of HMR and Tailwind purge are the reasons Vite is used and not Bun's bundler.
- Tailwind is used via the only CSS file served: `global.css` as it is ideal not to serve any other css via JS in the app but only use Tailwind.
